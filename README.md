**Project**
<pre>
This is a 4-man project,
I participated in the script of game mode manager
(i.e. start game and settings, zombie survival with end points, and time-limit mode)
and the levels design.

But I think the locomotion made by teamates are really suck, which feels dizzy (even I am a 10-years-up FPS player).
Zombie AI's are too simple, may be due to lack of animation.
Although the FPS part is ok, my first-time level design and the textures are not good, which cannot feel the vibe of zombie horror.
Overall, it is a great experience but a little bit shame to publish.
