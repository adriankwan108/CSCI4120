**Introduction**
<pre>
This is an experience in level editing and some scripting.

I recreate scene of the University Mall of CUHK (林蔭大道 / 百萬大道)  in UE4.24.
Some part of texture and models are made by Quixel,
some of them are created by myself,
i.e. photo some texture in-situ, 
     build models with the default constructive solid geometry and Blender

In addition,I script a lift at the middle of fountain.
